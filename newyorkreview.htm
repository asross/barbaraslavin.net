      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Throughout the Bush 
      years in Washington, the issue of what to do about Iran was often reduced 
      to a question of whether or not to talk to the Iranian regime. Those who 
      insisted on silence saw Iran starkly as a &quot;state sponsor of terrorism,&quot; 
      controlled by fanatics grimly bent on making atom bombs. Only the threat 
      of force, they claimed, could persuade Iran to change its ways or, better 
      yet, to change its nature as an Islamic republic. An opposing camp 
      declared that America would be wiser to accept Iran as a regional power 
      and to encourage pragmatic elements within its leadership. Their hope was 
      to build trust through diplomacy so that Iran would not feel the need for 
      a nuclear deterrent. The ideal outcome would be a Grand Bargain based on 
      the common interest of forging a more secure Middle East.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">By last spring, the 
      argument between these camps had escalated to the point where some 
      conservatives, including President Bush and the Republican presidential 
      candidate, John McCain, insinuated that Barack Obama's declared 
      willingness to talk to Iran amounted to &quot;appeasement,&quot; a term loaded with 
      the shame of Britain's capitulation to Hitler at Munich. Although the US 
      Treasury has recently tightened economic sanctions on Iran, such 
      shrillness has now subsided. In its waning months the Bush administration 
      has broken with its previous policy by sending William Burns, a senior 
      State Department official, to multiparty talks on the Iranian nuclear 
      issue. It has even made preliminary plans to open a &quot;US interests 
      section,&quot; or low-level diplomatic office, within the Swiss embassy in the 
      Iranian capital, Tehran—an initiative that is typically a first step 
      toward restoring normal relations. US officials are also understood to 
      have counseled Israel, the country that feels most threatened by the 
      prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran, to refrain from preemptive action.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">These moves have come 
      partly in response to expert advice, much of which warns that the military 
      option is too risky: air strikes cannot guarantee to stop Iran from 
      getting the bomb, yet would likely ignite a cataclysmic regional backlash, 
      particularly in Iraq. The fragility of the global economy has cooled 
      tempers, too, since any threat to oil supplies from the Persian Gulf could 
      destroy chances of a recovery. Bitter experience has also shown that 
      shunning Iran, and brandishing sticks without accommodating legitimate 
      Iranian concerns, have merely served to entrench Tehran's own hard-liners. 
      Not only has Iran defiantly accelerated its nuclear program, it has also 
      made embarrassing strategic inroads, via such ideological allies as 
      Hezbollah and Hamas, against American interests in Lebanon, Palestine, and 
      Iraq.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The Democrats' crushing 
      electoral sweep in November has made likely a further shift toward 
      engagement, although the incoming team has added caveats to Barack Obama's 
      declared preference for diplomacy, such as saying that any meetings with 
      Iranian leaders would have to be well prepared and timely, reiterating 
      that it would be &quot;unacceptable&quot; for Iran to go nuclear, and insisting that 
      the military option remains &quot;on the table.&quot; Meanwhile, the more bellicose 
      parts of America's foreign policy establishment appear to be regrouping so 
      as to maintain subtler, less overtly partisan pressure against 
      &quot;appeasement.&quot; Even relative hawks such as Henry Kissinger and Brent 
      Scowcroft now say that diplomacy must be given a chance, if only to build 
      international legitimacy for eventual, stronger US action.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In other words, there 
      is a growing consensus among both conservative and liberal policy analysts 
      in Washington around a strategy of robust engagement with Iran. It is not 
      yet clear how ambitious this approach will be—whether the objective is 
      simply to stop Iran from building a bomb or to aim for the elusive Grand 
      Bargain covering such issues as Gulf security, the future of Iraq and 
      Afghanistan, and Arab–Israeli peace. It is certain that Iran will prove to 
      be an extremely difficult negotiating partner, if indeed it is willing to 
      put its cards on the table. But at least a stronger effort will be made to 
      coax, cajole, and persuade Iran's leadership that it has much to gain 
      through compromise, and much to lose without it.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Troublingly, however, 
      there remains at both ends of the Iran policy spectrum a certain vagueness 
      about exactly whom America might be engaging. This is not merely a 
      confusion about whom to address within the Iranian regime's complex 
      hierarchy. It extends to a broader lack of clarity about where these 
      people come from, what shapes their views, what they really fear, and what 
      they really want. This vagueness entails a danger that the underlying 
      assumptions on which future policy will be based could prove inaccurate or 
      misleading. Often, in the past, it has been precisely such 
      misapprehensions that have undermined attempts at rapprochement, or 
      perhaps more accurately, enabled saboteurs in both countries to undermine 
      them.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In her lucid and 
      enlightening account of Iranian–American relations, Bitter Friends, Bosom 
      Enemies, Barbara Slavin, a longtime diplomatic correspondent for USA Today 
      who recently became a managing editor of The Washington Times and has long 
      been one of the most astute American reporters on Iran, chronicles a sad 
      litany of missed opportunities for improved relations, most of them 
      derailed by the ill-timed intervention of hard-liners on either side. This 
      could even be described as the defining dynamic of the troubled 
      relationship. In both countries, opponents of rapprochement have seized on 
      any hint of hostility to score points against domestic political rivals by 
      raising the tone of nationalist rhetoric. Alternatively, they have brushed 
      off friendly signals as evidence of weakness, and as proof that only 
      hardball tactics produce results. This does not mean that the achievement 
      of an American–Iranian détente would have been certain had such 
      opportunities been pursued, but rather that the delicate machinery needed 
      to produce such a result was never properly constructed, and so never set 
      in motion.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">A typical example of 
      this occurred in 2002, when the popular, reformist administration of 
      President Mohammad Khatami sorely needed some friendly signal from America 
      to counter its increasingly aggressive conservative critics. But instead 
      of being rewarded for its condemnation of the September 11 attacks or its 
      vital assistance in ousting the Taliban from Afghanistan—Iran supported 
      the Northern Alliance and provided intelligence to US forces about Taliban 
      forces—Iran found itself melodramatically branded by George Bush, in a 
      State of the Union speech, as a member of an &quot;axis of evil.&quot; The sudden, 
      sharp escalation of rhetoric shocked Iranians profoundly, leaving 
      proponents of warmer ties dangerously exposed. This logical result was 
      apparently unanticipated in Washington. Condoleezza Rice, then the 
      national security adviser, admitted as much. &quot;What is funny about it is 
      that [the phrase] didn't really catch my eye,&quot; she told Barbara Slavin, in 
      a stunning admission of diplomatic insensitivity.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Chastened, but still 
      keen to improve relations, Iranian diplomats put out feelers at the time 
      of the Iraq invasion some months later, only to be rebuffed again. 
      Neoconservatives within the Bush administration, it seems, were convinced 
      that the blitzkrieg in Iraq would frighten neighboring Iran into 
      submission, with no need for diplomacy. &quot;We don't speak to evil&quot; was the 
      blunt retort from Vice President Dick Cheney, supported by Defense 
      Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, when presented with Iranian proposals for broad 
      negotiations that would address Iran's nuclear program, Iraq, and 
      Iranian-supported groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, in exchange for full 
      diplomatic recognition and an end to US economic sanctions. As Trita Parsi 
      recounts in his meticulously researched book Treacherous Alliance: The 
      Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States, the brusque 
      rejection prompted not an Iranian surrender, but a circling of wagons by 
      revolutionary hard-liners, who subsequently made a determined push to 
      purge the relative liberals who had prospered under Khatami, thus putting 
      an end to hopes for internal reform, let alone for a broader accommodation 
      with the US.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Needless to say, for 
      its part revolutionary Iran has proven even more inept at judging the 
      Great Satan's moods and responses. The extraordinary obtuseness of Mahmoud 
      Ahmadinejad, Iran's current president, in questioning the historical 
      reality of the Holocaust is a case in point. Such antics are, 
      understandably, seen by Americans in the context of more overtly 
      provocative acts, beginning with the 1979–1980 hostage crisis, extending 
      through such ugly policies as the assassination of dissidents, and 
      including Iran's association with groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, 
      which official America deems terrorist. And while the chant of &quot;Death to 
      America&quot; may no longer resonate much with ordinary Iranians, it has 
      remained a touchstone for politicians, a reflexive reaffirmation of 
      revolutionary values, rather as the blasting of communism was for American 
      politicians during the cold war.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Yet in the American 
      case, tin-eared diplomacy cannot be explained away as the product of sheer 
      ignorance or as a matter of ritual adherence to a strident ideology. Since 
      the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been the subject of intense American 
      scrutiny. A simple search under &quot;Iran Politics&quot; at Amazon.com produces 
      nearly four thousand titles, evidence not only of a national fascination 
      with one of the very few countries still to proclaim opposition to 
      American power, but also of the abiding interest that Iranian émigrés, who 
      number nearly 400,000 in the United States, take in their homeland.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Sadly, much of 
      America's intellectual output on the subject of Iran, and particularly 
      since the eruption of the nuclear issue, has been marked by 
      panic-mongering cant. Some of this is generated by disgruntled exiles, 
      including many linked to royalist and leftist parties that have as little 
      resonance inside Iran as did the well-heeled Iraqi expatriates who lobbied 
      for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein; and some by a chorus of foreign 
      policy &quot;experts&quot; in Washington, many of them familiar as cheerleaders for 
      the invasion of Iraq, such as the columnist Max Boot, the former CIA head 
      James Woolsey, and the right-wing scholar Michael Ledeen. &quot;IS THE WORLD 
      READY FOR NUCLEAR JIHAD?&quot; shrieks the back cover of one typical product, 
      Showdown With Nuclear Iran, a book coauthored by Jerome Corsi, a serial 
      ranter whose muck-splattering &quot;biography&quot; of Barack Obama won brief 
      notoriety this fall.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Wiser minds have also 
      been at work, and the past year's crop of serious and useful books about 
      Iran has been unusually rich. Barbara Slavin's look at Iranian–American 
      relations should be indispensable to policymakers, as should Trita Parsi's 
      seminal work, which argues, persuasively, that America's aims in the 
      Middle East will continue to be thwarted until it addresses more 
      pragmatically the core underlying problem of Israeli–Iranian rivalry.[1]</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Kasra Naji, a seasoned 
      Iranian journalist, has written a critical and revealing biography of 
      Iran's controversial president. Tracing his rise through the revolutionary 
      nomenclatura, Naji explains the shadowy links that tie Ahmadinejad to an 
      inner network of radical conservatives. The President's popularity has now 
      eroded to the point that he may well fail to secure a second term in next 
      summer's elections, but Naji's description of Iran's quirky political 
      mechanics remains essential to understanding how the clash between the 
      country's theocratic and democratic tendencies, with the former 
      increasingly dominant, can still produce unexpected results.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The more enigmatic, far 
      more powerful figure of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Islamic Republic's 
      sixty-nine-year-old Supreme Leader, is the subject of an extremely timely 
      and thorough, albeit concise, investigation by Karim Sadjadpour, a scholar 
      at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Sadjadpour observes 
      that Khamenei's contempt for America has proven to be &quot;remarkably 
      consistent and enduring&quot; throughout a career that has spanned two terms as 
      president of the Islamic Republic (1981–1989), followed by nearly two 
      decades as Supreme Leader. Yet he also notes that Khamenei has shown 
      flexibility at times. &quot;The day that relations with America prove 
      beneficial to the Iranian nation I will be the first to approve of that,&quot; 
      declared the Supreme Leader earlier this year.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">For a broader and 
      deeper exploration of contemporary Iran, Christopher de Bellaigue's The 
      Struggle for Iran offers both fine sensibility and a keen critical eye. A 
      fluent Farsi speaker and frequent contributor to these pages, de Bellaigue 
      experienced firsthand both the heady rise of the reformists under Khatami 
      and their subsequent, depressing fall. His collection of essays, though 
      observed over several years, illuminates his subject all the more because 
      its eclectic parts reflect the kind of slow, subtle shifts in mood that 
      instant reporting inevitably fails to capture. Three years before 
      Ahmadinejad's surprise electoral triumph in 2005, de Bellaigue judged 
      presciently that unless reformers can muster allies in the conservative 
      establishment, or find new ways to bring public pressure on it, Iran seems 
      fated to an unyielding form of Islamic rule.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">More lighthearted but 
      equally profound in insight is Hooman Majd's delightfully unclassifiable 
      book, The Ayatollah Begs to Differ. Part travelogue, part reminiscence, 
      and shifting between bemusement, grudging respect, and despair, this 
      digressive essay in cultural interpretation reflects the unique 
      perspective of a thoroughly cosmopolitan Westerner who also happens to be 
      the grandson of a turbaned senior cleric. While blithely exposing 
      hypocrisies and paradoxes, Majd does not spare the Islamic Republic's 
      critics, either. Happening on a gaggle of New Yorkers demonstrating 
      against a visit by Ahmadinejad, he discovers that at least one has been 
      lured from the Bowery Mission with the promise of $15 and a T-shirt.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">This book is a vital 
      antidote to both the wishful thinking of exiles who declare the Islamic 
      Revolution's inevitable doom and to the exaggerated alarm of those who see 
      it as an existential threat to the world order. It also provides some very 
      American clues to understanding the Iranian experience. &quot;It is in some 
      ways as if evangelical Christians had had their way in the White House, in 
      Congress, in state governments, on the Supreme Court, and in the schools 
      for a generation,&quot; Majd writes. &quot;Perhaps not a perfect analogy, for 
      America is far more diverse than Iran and the majority probably less 
      religious, but an analogy of sorts nonetheless.&quot;</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Given the legacy of 
      mistrust and the range of prickly issues that separate America and Iran, 
      the Obama administration faces immense obstacles in trying to steer toward 
      less troubled waters. But at least some excellent charts are at hand for 
      gaining a better fix on Iran's tides, reefs, and shoals.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Persia's many empires, 
      starting with the Achaemenid dynasty in the sixth century BC, have come 
      and gone. Its modern avatar seems far removed from the benign overlordship 
      for which ancient Persia was known, although behind the Islamic Republic's 
      drearily monochrome façade the country remains an amalgam of tribes, 
      ethnicities, and faiths, spread across a continental range of climates and 
      topographies. Yet there does linger something haughtily imperial in the 
      Iranian worldview. It is an attitude that should be familiar to 
      present-day Americans, or to Britons of recent generations: a certain 
      defiant insularity, combined with a sense of national entitlement to 
      respect as a great and morally superior power.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Perhaps this is not 
      surprising. Even in its reduced state, Iran looks out over a wider sphere 
      that includes numerous kinsmen. Links of language tie it closely to 
      speakers of Dari (a form of Persian that is the main language of 
      Afghanistan) and Tajik, as well as more distantly to Pashtuns, Kurds, 
      Baluchis, and even Ossetians. The state religion of the Islamic Republic, 
      the Jaafari or Twelver form of Shiism professed by nine out of ten 
      Iranians, happens also to be the majority faith in neighboring Azerbaijan, 
      Iraq, and Bahrain. Twelver Shia minorities in Lebanon, Afghanistan, Saudi 
      Arabia, Kuwait, and Pakistan also regard Iran as a pole of their religious 
      identity. And then there is the wider Muslim world: it is overwhelmingly 
      Sunni in sectarian terms and so rejects the claim of Iran's Supreme 
      Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, to the supplementary title of Commander of the 
      Muslims. Yet Muslims admire Iran both as a wellspring of Islamic 
      civilization and as a unique political experiment.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">There are other reasons 
      for the self-importance of Iran's rulers. They hold what may be the 
      world's second-largest reserves of both liquid oil and natural gas. For 
      Europe this makes Iran a potential counterweight to Vladimir Putin's 
      Russia, which currently, to Europe's considerable anxiety, supplies most 
      of the continent's imported gas. Asian countries, particularly the booming 
      giants India and China, also thirst for Iran's poorly exploited 
      hydrocarbons. So does America, yet the global superpower's main 
      contribution to inflating the Iranian ego has been the chorus of Bush 
      administration officials, right-wing think tanks, and, most recently, a 
      &quot;bipartisan&quot; panel,[2] all proclaiming the Islamic Republic to be the most 
      significant single threat to America's interests.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The revolutionary 
      regime can cause trouble, as when it attempts, quite successfully, to 
      thwart American ambitions in places such as Lebanon and Iraq, where it has 
      been able to exert influence through its ties to several of the leading 
      Shiite parties and clerics and through its financial support for Shiite 
      holy sites. Or when it threatens to seal the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow 
      bottleneck through which vast volumes of oil pour forth from the Persian 
      Gulf. The very real possibility of Iran achieving nuclear status is cited 
      as a terrible peril, too. Fearful of the bombast of Iranian leaders who 
      have said that the Jewish state will be &quot;erased from the pages of history&quot; 
      and of Iran's development of long-range missiles that could reach Israeli 
      cities, Israelis have raised the specter of a new Holocaust. Others fear 
      an accelerated arms race in the region, with powers such as Saudi Arabia, 
      Turkey, and Egypt rushing to balance Iran's strength with their own 
      nuclear weapons. Much cited is the possibility that Iranian nuclear 
      weapons could be acquired by foreign terrorists.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Yet for all its bluster 
      Iran remains a strategic featherweight. In the event of any real conflict, 
      the Islamic Republic would prove decisively outmatched. A glance at the 
      map of forces arrayed around the region, which includes not merely a ring 
      of US bases and facilities in nearly every neighboring country, but also 
      such nearby, nuclear-armed powers as India, Israel, Pakistan, and Russia, 
      suffices to make clear Iran's strategic isolation. The country is also 
      poor, starved of foreign investment, clumsily managed, and wholly 
      dependent on energy exports. Its universities are good but far from 
      outstanding, and Iran has suffered a crippling, two- generation-long drain 
      of much of its best talent.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">It is notable, too, 
      that until the Bush administration opened unexpected opportunities for 
      Iran to do so, the Islamic Republic had proved remarkably incapable of 
      extending its political or ideological influence, except perhaps among 
      Shia Lebanese and the Iraqi Shiites with whom it continues to have 
      relations. As Christopher de Bellaigue notes:</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The revolutionaries 
      found it hard to sell a political philosophy that is based on Shia 
      exclusiveness and informed, despite Iran's claims to be advocating 
      supranational ideas, by Persian chauvinism.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Indeed, it is precisely 
      the mismatch between revolutionary Iran's vaulting ambitions and its 
      modest achievements that underpins other important aspects of its leaders' 
      behavior. In attempting to explain why their theodemocratic experiment has 
      failed to produce either worldly or spiritual greatness, the mullahs and 
      militants who are currently ascendant harp repeatedly on two perceived 
      causes, one internal, the other external.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The first excuse is 
      that the Islamic project remains incomplete because it has been 
      insufficiently revolutionary. This, as Kasra Naji reminds us in his 
      biography of Ahmadinejad, is a standard trope for regimes suffering from 
      public disenchantment. Much as Stalin, Mao, or Castro sought to 
      reinvigorate their aging revolutions with varied, often brutal forms of 
      mass mobilization, Iran's true believers have tried to recharge theirs. 
      Hence we find Ahmadinejad promising voters before his election somehow to 
      extract every policy, project, and method &quot;from the heart of Islam.&quot; &quot;If 
      we return to the culture of Islam,&quot; de Bellaigue quotes him as saying, 
      &quot;you'll see tomorrow what kind of heaven this place becomes.&quot;</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Predictably, along with 
      the heightened rhetoric came increased attention to revolutionary symbols 
      such as &quot;Islamic&quot; dress, a silencing of dissent that included a fierce 
      clampdown on the press and sweeping purges of personnel, and a 
      reconcentration of power in the hands of a trusted &quot;vanguard.&quot; The 
      Revolutionary Guards, or Sepah, the parallel military force created at the 
      time of the revolution to counterbalance the national army, came to 
      function, in the words of Hooman Majd, rather as an Iranian version of the 
      École Nationale d'Administration, the school that supplies France's 
      managerial caste. Barbara Slavin estimates that during Ahmadinejad's term, 
      Sepah alumni have come to fill half the cabinet, two thirds of the 
      provincial governorships, a third of parliamentary seats, and much of the 
      top management in the religious foundations, or bonyads, that control a 
      giant slice of Iran's economy.[3]</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Ahmadinejad also 
      reintroduced an element of class animosity that harked back to the 1980s. 
      His modest style, rumpled suits, shaggy haircuts, and preference for his 
      own house over a grand official residence served as a reprimand to 
      political rivals guilty of backsliding from revolutionary austerity. 
      Hooman Majd tells the amusing tale of seeking out the President's chief 
      press adviser and finding the important official, after some effort, in a 
      dingy unmarked office wearing plastic sandals. Conversely, he discovers 
      that the rich, hedonistic Iranians who bemoan such things from behind high 
      walls seem to resent their leaders less because of their policies than 
      because of their lowly origins.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The alternative excuse 
      for the Islamic Republic's failings is that foreign enemies are to blame. 
      Because they are fearful that Iran's Islamic model will emerge triumphant 
      over ideologies such as capitalism or socialism, the sermon-like argument 
      goes, foreign governments have plotted at every turn to undermine the 
      Islamic regime. It is Iran's noble fate to struggle for justice against 
      such global tyranny, just as the Iranian people fought to overthrow their 
      Shah. In particular, and to an exaggerated extent, Iran's revolutionaries 
      have actually come to define themselves by their opposition to America, 
      which they see as the force of international arrogance that personifies 
      worldly injustice.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Religious imagery 
      infuses such ideas. &quot;Shias are always Davids,&quot; says Hooman Majd, using the 
      oft-cited biblical tale mentioned in the Koran.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">To them, there is no 
      Goliath today greater than the United States. The Ayatollahs and all their 
      little Davids are determined to stand up to it whenever necessary, 
      whenever the cause is just, and to never lose, even if, or maybe because, 
      they can't win outright.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In a typical speech 
      quoted by Sadjadpour, Ayatollah Khamenei asserts that what America expects 
      from Iran is nothing less than submission and surrender to its hegemony. 
      &quot;This is the real motive for US claims regarding weapons of mass 
      destruction, human rights or democracy,&quot; the Supreme Leader adds.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Sadly, recent history 
      provides plenty of reinforcement for this self-image as the perpetual 
      underdog. True, Iran avoided outright colonization by the West, unlike 
      most of its neighbors. Yet Britain and America did conspire, in the 1950s, 
      to overthrow the liberal, nationalist government of Mohammad Mossadegh and 
      reinstate the Shah, mainly in order to secure better terms for Iranian 
      oil.[4] (Ironically, the coup plotters' allies included senior mullahs who 
      disliked the liberals' secular tendencies.) America and its many allies 
      also, shamefully, supported Saddam Hussein's Iraq during the appalling 
      carnage of its 1980–1988 war against the Islamic Republic, one of whose 
      many ugly chapters included the shooting down of a scheduled civilian 
      Iranian airliner by the US Navy.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Understandably, many 
      Iranians saw the war as a cynical attempt to bleed their revolution dry. 
      In fact, its main results were to provide nationalist cover to Ayatollah 
      Khomeini as he went about crushing internal opposition to his Islamist 
      project; to enshrine the Islamic revolution within a national myth of 
      martyrdom; and to generate the embittered class of veterans, united by 
      memories of wartime sacrifice and camaraderie, that gave rise to such 
      figures as Ahmadinejad.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Even so, the xenophobia 
      of the revolutionary elite does seem to verge on the pathological. Hooman 
      Majd notes with some amusement that one of Ahmadinejad's closest advisers, 
      Mojtaba Hashemi-Samareh, actually wrote a guidebook for Iranian diplomats 
      titled The Psychology of the Infidels. It advises, among other things, 
      that representatives of the Islamic Republic should never wear lace-up 
      shoes or sharply creased trousers, since these might be taken as telltale 
      signs of their having neglected prayers. The removal of dozens of 
      experienced ambassadors under Ahmadinejad, and their replacement with 
      firmer ideologues, may have been the work of Hashemi-Samareh. This would 
      go some way to explaining why Iran's hectoring style of diplomacy over the 
      past few years has won so few friends.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">We cannot know to what 
      degree such a figure as Ayatollah Khamenei shares this mix of extreme 
      paranoia regarding the outside world and quiet dread that the Iranian 
      masses no longer believe in the revolution's utopian promise. Yet it is 
      highly likely that such insecurities contribute to his regime's tenacious 
      determination to master the uranium enrichment process needed to build a 
      bomb.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">To a foreign observer, 
      Iran's pursuit of a costly nuclear program can only be seen as quixotic or 
      threatening, considering such factors as the country's vast but 
      underexploited conventional energy supplies, its record of hiding atomic 
      research, its development of long-range missiles, and its expansion of the 
      program into uranium enrichment with the excuse that this will make Iran 
      energy-independent, even though the country has limited uranium reserves 
      and no functioning reactors to consume the enriched fuel. But to Iran's 
      revolutionary elite the nuclear program has come to be seen as crucial for 
      its symbolism far more than for its practical utility. In their view, it 
      addresses internal and external troubles at once.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The nuclear 
      breakthrough is meant to inspire jaded citizens, providing much-needed 
      proof of Iran's return to glory, as well as evidence that technology and 
      theocracy, Islam and modernity, can fruitfully coexist. Official 
      propaganda, referring to statements by Ayatollah Khamenei that abjure use 
      of atomic weapons by Muslims, insists that the program is purely aimed at 
      producing nuclear energy for Iran's civilian needs. Ordinary Iranians may 
      be skeptical of this, but even so demand to know why their ancient and 
      proud country should be denied atomic bombs, if such dangerous parvenus as 
      Israel and Pakistan can have them.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">As for the foreign 
      menace, Iran's nuclear prowess is meant to announce its reemergence as a 
      power to be reckoned with. This does not necessitate actual building and 
      deployment of weapons, but merely showing the ability to do so. Obviously, 
      because they profess peaceful intent, Iran's leaders have not articulated 
      a military rationale for a weapons program. To the outside observer, 
      however, it seems clear that should Iran develop nuclear weapons, they 
      could only serve as a deterrent rather than as offensive weapons, since 
      their use would invite annihilation.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The scenario of Iran 
      passing nukes to terrorists sounds fanciful, too. Its ayatollahs are 
      certain to remain sharply at odds with the Sunni jihadists who abhor 
      Shiism. And much as Iran's leaders dote on Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite 
      party's own pragmatic commanders are well aware that any Iranian gift of 
      nonconventional weapons would invite their instant ostracism from Lebanese 
      politics, let alone the full destructive wrath of Israel.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">In other words, the 
      nuclear project is most likely conceived not so much as a means for 
      projecting power as it is part of a strategy for regime survival. Trying 
      simply to prise this toy from Iran's leadership, then, is likely to prove 
      futile. The current alternative, of piling on trade sanctions that make 
      clear to ordinary Iranians their diplomatic isolation, as well as the 
      burdensome cost of pursuing the nuclear option, is not much better. Iran's 
      more extreme elements thrive on such punishment, while those worst 
      affected are private businessmen whom many Iranians regard as sharks and 
      profiteers anyway.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The fact is that 
      despite the weariness of many Iranians with their regime, the combination 
      of innate nationalism, political fatigue, and fears for personal 
      livelihoods have rendered the Iranian public relatively quiescent. In the 
      view of Hooman Majd: the Ayatollahs may from time to time silence dissent 
      at home, they may rule autocratically and with their infuriating manners 
      they may annoy and even repulse many in the West, but they rule for now 
      with the confidence that they do not face a population that seeks to 
      overthrow them.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">To deal with such 
      leaders will require diplomatic skills of the highest order, including 
      understanding, careful coordination with allies, and, above all, patience. 
      Current trends within Iran, although difficult to read, suggest a slight 
      swing of the power pendulum away from hard-liners. Elections last year to 
      the council that will eventually choose a Supreme Leader to succeed 
      Ayatollah Khamenei produced a centrist majority. President Ahmadinejad 
      faces growing challenges from both conservative pragmatists and reformers, 
      and may not survive beyond next June's elections. Yet even should the 
      ebullient radical remain in office, some analysts assert that he would be 
      better placed to make diplomatic concessions than a more conciliatory 
      politician, who would be exposed to attacks from the nationalist right.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Inklings of a more 
      positive American– Iranian dialogue are already emerging over Iraq. 
      Following initial, fierce resistance to any deal that would legitimize a 
      continued US military presence, Iran has proved surprisingly supportive 
      now that Iraq's government has ratified a status-of-forces agreement. This 
      reflects not only relief that America is committed to eventual withdrawal, 
      but also tacit recognition that Washington and Tehran share some common 
      strategic goals in Iraq, such as reducing the level of violence, 
      strengthening state institutions, curbing Kurdish separatist ambitions, 
      and preserving a semblance of democracy in which the Shiite majority is 
      likely to remain dominant.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">Issues such as Iran's 
      opposition to American peacemaking efforts in the Arab–Israeli conflict, 
      defining an Iranian role in Gulf security that is acceptable to its 
      smaller neighbors, and Iran's nuclear program, could each prove far 
      trickier. Useful quid pro quos do exist for all these questions, but 
      arranging for exchanges of concessions by multiple parties, in a sequence 
      that enhances mutual confidence, is no easy task. While a large-scale 
      agreement on all the issues is obviously unlikely, it would still be wise 
      for American policymakers to keep the big picture in mind, and to focus on 
      the positive allure of a region-wide peace rather than to fret over 
      lurking dangers.[5]</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 9pt">The key task will be to 
      prove to the Iranians that the potential rewards for releasing Iran from 
      its current dilemma are immense. To a purely rational observer this might 
      seem easy, when we consider the country's enormous, unrealized economic 
      and human potential, and its lack of real, as opposed to largely 
      imaginary, enemies. But Iran's clerical rulers, whose job it is to chase 
      demons, will surely find devils in every detail. The biggest of all may 
      prove to be one spotted by Christopher de Bellaigue. &quot;It is clear that 
      Iran's leaders are trying to stem the tide of history,&quot; he says, &quot;which 
      tends, sooner or later, to submerge inflexible ideologies and their 
      autocratic proponents.&quot;<br>
